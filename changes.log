TESTNG-239  	 Copy Exception Message
    Added MessageCopyAction, refactoring TraceCopyAction so both are minor variations on AbstractTraceAction, 
    so that a right click on the failure trace offers the option of copying only the trace.
    revision 93.

Rev 95: "method launcher name when created from outline view is no longer null"

Rev 96 "rename variable to keep class conventions and reduce confusion between it 
and a local method name, thus removing the method launcher's inclination 
to lose its method name"  src/main/org/testng/eclipse/ui/util/ConfigurationHelper.java

Rev 97 "Better detection of end of exception message" FailureTrace.java

Rev.98
Refactored TestHierarchyTab and FailureTab so that they use nearly the same code,
putting in their own labels, except that for the FailureTab the test items are 
not added to the displayed tree until they are known to fail.
Fixes TESTNG-245     
  Unify 'All Tests' and 'Failed Tests' with the only difference being filtering for failures.
