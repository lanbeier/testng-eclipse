Patched TestSearchEngine so search for packages works again.


summary before running additions:
launcher:
   Added ability to choose by package
   Added ability to choose by method; 
     if a class is already chosen, only methods in that class are offered
   Changed group box to be writable. This is necessary so that groups from
     generated code, which cannot be found by searching static code, can be used.
  
     
test run tabs:
   If a 'test description' is available through 'getTestName()', it is 
     displayed. This is useful when a Factory is running many instances with 
     the same test method.
    
     
re-running failed test:
   jvm args from the original launcher are now preserved
   If a 'test description' is available through 'getTestName()', it is
      made available with a jvm arg. This is useful if a Factory wishes to 
      re-run only the failed instances.
